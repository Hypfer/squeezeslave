2010-12-28 13:37  paddockd

	* [r225] Applied slimproto partial send patch from mbennett. Thanks
	  Mike.
	  
	  This is a patch to slimproto (SlimProtoLib) to deal with
	  SOCK_STREAM sends correctly when partial writes occur.
	  
	  Justification: when dealing with SOCK_DGRAM (UDP) sockets,
	  send()s
	  are all-or-nothing; slimproto.c seems to expect this behavior
	  from
	  the socket, but SOCK_STREAM (TCP) sockets can accept partial
	  writes
	  in the socket buffer, requiring the application resend the
	  unqueued
	  portion of the message.
	  
	  The potential impact of a partially written message assumed to
	  have been fully written is that the receiver will see a malformed
	  message stream, resulting in loss of message synchronization on
	  the
	  socket, which would require closing of the connection. This would
	  most likely occur during network congestion or overload.
	  
	  This patch provides this send-a-full-message functionality behind
	  a
	  new 'send_message' routine which perform send() operations until
	  the entire message has been accepted by the socket.
	  
	  - mike bennett 27dec10 (mbennett in the slimdevices forum)
	  
	  Increased version to 225.
